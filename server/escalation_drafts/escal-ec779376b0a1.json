  "body": "Dear [Facilitator/Mentor Name],\n\nI hope you are having a productive week. I am reaching out to kindly request an update or clarification regarding the grading status for my recent work in [Course Name].\n\nCurrently, I am unable to view the final score or feedback for the [Insert Assignment Name] module. To ensure this wasn't a technical error, I have already verified my submission history in the LMS to confirm the file was successfully uploaded and have checked the course syllabus to confirm the standard grading turnaround time. I also cross-referenced the grading rubrics to ensure all criteria were met on my end.\n\nCould you please check if there is a synchronization issue between the instructor portal and the student gradebook, or let me know if any further action is required from my side? I appreciate your time and help in ensuring my records are up to date.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]",
