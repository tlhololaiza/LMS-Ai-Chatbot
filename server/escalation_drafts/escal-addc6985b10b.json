    "assistant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm here to help you with your learning journey.\n\nIf you are currently working on your React modules, I can help explain key concepts to you. For example, we could dive into:\n\n*   **Props:** These are \"properties\" used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are read-only, which helps keep your components predictable and reusable.\n*   **useEffect:** This is a powerful Hook used to manage side effects in your functional components, like fetching data from an API or manually updating the DOM.\n\nWould you like to explore one of these topics in more detail, or do you have a specific question about your coursework? I'm here to help!\n\n---\n### 📚 Sources\n❓ [1] How do I pass data from child to parent component?
